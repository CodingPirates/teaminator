# teaminator
Coding Pirates Teaminator used for generating some of the teams for Coding Pirates Game Jam 2015!

It was made in 1 day in OOP PHP and the database connection with PDO.

Evaluation after using the Teaminator
-------------------------------------
Overall, it worked well, however, had I had more time, I would have made it
more flexible, so I can more easily move members around teams.

We used phpMyAdmin to move team members around, but it took some time due to
having to look at ID, and using that. It would have been nice with an interface.

Some teams had already formed in advance based on friendships, etc., so if they
needed any people, we generated a smaller team for them (that's why you can
write how many you want in a team).

It would have been nice to have imported the whole list of participants so we
could have had all the teams in one place instead of using a lot of time on it
during the game jam.

Another nice thing would be to have shown the age and interests on the show teams
page. Maybe even the thing we selected them from (if they have selected multiple
things).

Other than that it went fine.
